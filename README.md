This respository investigates  gravity, a modified theory of gravity that extends general relativity by incorporating the non-metricity scalar . The foundation is on the theoretical underpinnings and computational modeling, with applications in cosmology and gravitational phenomena. 
The primary focus is on understanding how this framework can describe the evolution of the universe, offering potential alternatives to dark energy or other extensions to standard gravity. Using computational methods, the project analyzes field equations, simulates cosmological dynamics, and visualizes the effects of f(Q) on large-scale structures in the universe.
The goal is to explore how  influences the dynamics of the universe and test its potential as an alternative to dark energy or other modifications to standard gravity.
